This line has been added after the file has been deleted from Linux and commit had been made 

After deleting and commiting the changes in linux, I tried to make changes through Visual code studio and the file was ReadableStreamBYOBReader, and there was a merge conflict.After

But the file was restore in the GITHUB with new data.

This line has been added in windows to check for merge conflict.

This is to check merge conflict in Vscode.

Adding random line to check merge conflict in Visual code studio

In Visual code it will throw error that update were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally.
So first we need to do git pull origin

Then it will automatically show the merge confilct, then go to the merge confilct resolver and resolve the merge.
