This line has been added after the file has been deleted from Linux and commit had been made.

After deleting and commiting the changes in linux, I tried to make changes through Visual code studio and the file was restored, and there was a merge confilct.

But the file was restored in the GITHUB with new data.

This line has been added in Linux to check for merge conflict.
